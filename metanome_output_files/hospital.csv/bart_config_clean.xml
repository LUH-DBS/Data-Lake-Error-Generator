            All the fields are optional, but they may be crucial to obtain a good random sample.
            In order to choose the cells to modify, BART will scan the result of a viogen query
            using the following sampling algorithm:
            1) First, a number of tuples are skipped. This is a random number choosed btw 
                0 and (offsetFactor * tableSize)
            2) Then BART will scan the result and will pickup tuples 
            with a probability p = probabilityFactor.
            
            BART uses three kinds of queries
            - Symmetric queries: for symmetric viogen queries (see paper)
            - Inequality queries: for viogen queries without equalities (i.e. inequalities only)
            - Standard queries: for all other viogen queries
